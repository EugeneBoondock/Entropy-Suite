## Operational Excellence Guidelines

### 1. Code Quality & Best Practices

#### Universal Principles
- **Clean Code**: Write readable, maintainable, and well-structured code
- **Error Handling**: Implement comprehensive try-catch blocks and validation
- **Type Safety**: Use type hints in Python and TypeScript when applicable
- **Documentation**: Add meaningful docstrings and comments for complex logic
- **Security**: Never expose secrets, validate inputs, and follow security best practices
- **Performance**: Optimize algorithms and data structures for efficiency

#### Python Development Standards
```python
# Example of expected code quality
from typing import List, Dict, Optional
import logging

def process_data(items: List[Dict[str, any]], config: Optional[Dict] = None) -> Dict[str, any]:
    """
    Process data items according to configuration.
    
    Args:
        items: List of data items to process
        config: Optional configuration parameters
        
    Returns:
        Dictionary containing processed results and metadata
        
    Raises:
        ValueError: If items list is empty or invalid
    """
    if not items:
        raise ValueError("Items list cannot be empty")
    
    try:
        # Implementation with proper error handling
        results = {"processed": [], "errors": [], "total": len(items)}
        
        for item in items:
            # Process each item with validation
            pass
            
        return results
    except Exception as e:
        logging.error(f"Error processing data: {e}")
        raise
```

#### JavaScript/Node.js Standards
```javascript
// Example of expected code quality
/**
 * Asynchronous data processor with error handling
 * @param {Array} items - Data items to process
 * @param {Object} options - Processing options
 * @returns {Promise<Object>} Processing results
 */
async function processDataAsync(items, options = {}) {
    if (!Array.isArray(items) || items.length === 0) {
        throw new Error('Items must be a non-empty array');
    }
    
    try {
        const results = {
            processed: [],
            errors: [],
            total: items.length
        };
        
        // Use Promise.allSettled for concurrent processing
        const promises = items.map(async (item, index) => {
            try {
                // Process item implementation
                return { success: true, data: item, index };
            } catch (error) {
                return { success: false, error: error.message, index };
            }
        });
        
        const settled = await Promise.allSettled(promises);
        
        settled.forEach(result => {
            if (result.status === 'fulfilled') {
                results.processed.push(result.value);
            } else {
                results.errors.push(result.reason);
            }
        });
        
        return results;
    } catch (error) {
        console.error('Processing failed:', error);
        throw error;
    }
}
```
