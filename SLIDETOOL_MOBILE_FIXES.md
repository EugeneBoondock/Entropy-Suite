# SlideTool Mobile & Navigation Fixes

## Issues Fixed

### 1. **Non-Clickable Logo and Title**
- **Problem**: Logo and title in the toolbar were just static elements
- **Solution**: Wrapped them in a `<Link to="/">` component with hover effects
- **Result**: Users can now click the logo/title to navigate back to the main site

### 2. **Mobile Layout Chaos**
- **Problem**: Toolbar was cramped and unusable on mobile devices
- **Solution**: 
  - Restructured the input form and buttons with better responsive classes
  - Added `whitespace-nowrap` to prevent text wrapping
  - Improved spacing with `min-w-0` and better flex layouts
  - Made the "More" button only appear when there are slides
  - Added conditional loading messages for better UX

### 3. **Improved Mobile Navigation**
- **Problem**: No easy way to navigate to other parts of the site from the editor
- **Solution**: Added navigation links in the mobile menu:
  - "All Tools" link to `/tools`
  - "Pricing" link to `/pricing`
  - Proper dividers and organization

### 4. **Better Loading States**
- **Problem**: Confusing loading messages and poor mobile experience during AI generation
- **Solution**:
  - Dynamic loading messages: "AI is crafting your slides..." vs "Adding more slides..."
  - Added subtitle "This may take a moment"
  - Better responsive text sizing
  - Improved loading spinner positioning

### 5. **Enhanced Error Handling**
- **Problem**: Errors were not well displayed, especially on mobile
- **Solution**:
  - Added dedicated error state with clear visual feedback
  - Error messages with "Try Again" button
  - Better responsive error display

### 6. **Mobile Sidebar Improvements**
- **Problem**: Sidebar overlay detection wasn't working properly
- **Solution**:
  - Added proper `window` object checks for SSR compatibility
  - Improved mobile-specific classes and behavior
  - Added "Open Slides Menu" button when no slide is selected on mobile

### 7. **Responsive Button Improvements**
- **Problem**: Buttons were too small and hard to tap on mobile
- **Solution**:
  - Better padding and sizing across breakpoints
  - Improved icon spacing and text visibility
  - More descriptive loading states
